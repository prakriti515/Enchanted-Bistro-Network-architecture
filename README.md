Designed and implemented a robust cloud computing architecture for Enchanted Bistro, leveraging AWS services for scalability and reliability. Key components include a custom VPC ("Prakriti-Enchanted-Bistro-VPC"), strategically deployed across AWS "us-east-1" with redundancy in "AZ-A" and "AZ-B." Implemented subnets for scalability, NAT Gateways for internet access from private subnets, and security groups ("Enchanted-Bistro-SG") for traffic management. Configured Auto Scaling Groups ("Enchanted-Bistro-ASG") and an Application Load Balancer ("enchanted-prakriti-lb") for optimal resource utilization and web traffic distribution.
